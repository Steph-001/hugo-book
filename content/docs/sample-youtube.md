# Sample Chapter with YouTube

This chapter demonstrates the YouTube shortcode integration with the Hugo-book theme.

## YouTube Video Example

Here's an example of the YouTube shortcode:

{{< youtube "dQw4w9WgXcQ" "Sample YouTube Video" >}}


## Responsive Design for Videos

The YouTube shortcode is designed to be fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes from mobile phones to desktop computers. The video container maintains a 16:9 aspect ratio and scales appropriately on all devices.

## Multiple Video Examples

You can include multiple videos in a single chapter:

{{< youtube "dQw4w9WgXcQ" "Sample YouTube Video" >}}


{{< youtube "dQw4w9WgXcQ" "Sample YouTube Video" >}}

## Combining with Other Content

YouTube videos can be combined with other content types like text, images, and quizzes:

{{< image src="/images/sample.jpg" alt="Sample Image" caption="An image alongside video content" >}}

{{< quiz 
  question="What platform hosts the videos shown above?" 
  options="Vimeo|YouTube|Dailymotion|TikTok" 
  answer=1
  explanation="The videos are hosted on YouTube and embedded using the YouTube shortcode."
>}}
